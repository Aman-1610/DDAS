Data Download Duplication Alert System (DDAS) Overview
The Data Download Duplication Alert System (DDAS) is an AI-driven tool designed to prevent duplicate downloads in multi-user environments, conserving storage and bandwidth while improving data management.

Key Features
AI-Powered Duplicate Detection: Utilizes BERT (text), CNN (images), SimHash, and FAISS for accurate duplicate detection.
Real-Time Alerts: WebSocket integration provides instant notifications for potential duplicates.
Resource Optimization: Reduces redundant downloads to save resources.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Controls access based on user roles.
Audit Logging: Records actions for security and transparency.
Technology Stack
Backend: Java
Database: MySQL (metadata storage)
AI Models: BERT, CNN, SimHash, FAISS
Real-Time Alerts: WebSocket
Security: RBAC for permissions
Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Java (11+)
MySQL
AI Libraries: Deeplearning4j, TensorFlow Java, FAISS
WebSocket Libraries for Java
Installation:

Clone Repository: GitHub Link
Database Setup: Create a MySQL database (e.g., ddas_db) and configure credentials in config.properties.
Install Dependencies: Use Maven or Gradle to install necessary libraries.
Run Application:

bash
Copy code
java -jar DDAS.jar
Usage Workflow
User Download Request: Captures metadata when a user initiates a download.
AI-Powered Duplicate Detection: Uses AI models to analyze content:
Text: BERT
Image: CNN
Approximate Matching: SimHash and FAISS
Real-Time Notification: Alerts user if a duplicate is found.
Logging and Access Control: RBAC verifies permissions and logs actions.
System Architecture
User Request: Triggers metadata capture.
AI Model Processing: BERT, CNN, and SimHash process text and images.
Duplicate Detection: FAISS searches for duplicate vectors.
Notification: WebSocket sends real-time alerts.
Logging: Records all interactions in the database.

# DDAS
DDAS prevents duplicate data downloads in multi-user environments by using AI models (BERT, CNN, SimHash, FAISS) to analyze file content and metadata, alerting users in real time via WebSocket. It optimizes resources by reducing unnecessary downloads and includes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure access and logging for transparency.
